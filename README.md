# Respiratory Sound Classifier This is a Streamlit-based web application for classifying respiratory conditions from uploaded **WAV** audio recordings. It uses a pre-trained Scikit-learn model and a custom audio preprocessing pipeline. ## How to Run 1. Clone the repository ```bash git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git cd yourrepo ``` 2. (Optional) Create virtual environment ```bash python -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate ``` 3. Install dependencies ```bash pip install -r requirements.txt ``` Or manually: ```bash pip install streamlit librosa scikit-learn matplotlib pandas joblib ``` 4. Run the app ```bash streamlit run app.py ``` ## File Descriptions - `app.py` – Streamlit interface for uploading and classifying respiratory sounds. - `respiratory_pipeline.py` – Pipeline for audio preprocessing and feature extraction. - `respiratory_classifier.pkl` – Trained classifier model used for prediction. ## Notes - Only `.wav` files are supported. - Audio is automatically trimmed and features extracted using `librosa`. - Prediction results include the most likely class and confidence score. ## Example After launching the app, you’ll see a web page where you can upload a respiratory audio `.wav` file. The system will display a waveform and predict the condition with a confidence score.
